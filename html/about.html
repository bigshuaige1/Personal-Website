      <h3>CREATION CONCEPT</h3>
      <div class="line"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <p>I dismantled the design into four parts, "Touch", "Introduction", "Connection", and "Same".&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Touch" refers to the human body's tactile experience of feelings, time, space, environment, impressions, etc.; &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Introduction" refers to the designer's integration and collocation of tactile experience, including but not limited to extending human feelings about the outside world (nature, heaven and earth) to creation, and introducing human emotional memory into space. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Connection" refers to the designer's role of "mediation" to make the creation become the echo and continuation of the environment and history, so that the human body's feelings are mapped to the environment and reconnected with the creation.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Under the construction and interweaving of "connection", "sameness" is achieved, that is, it is integrated with people, heaven and earth, creation, past, future, etc.</p>

      <p>1. During this time, follow the teacher to explore the application scenarios of artificial intelligence technology.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. Continue to refine your design skills during this time.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. Create a "No Design Studio" in the sophomore year, deeply explore the behavior mode of creative expression, and strive to produce many results.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4. In the sophomore year, some output results will be explored for entrepreneurship and participate in the "Internet +" competition.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp5. Stabilize the GPA in the junior year, invest in practicing at large factories, focus on accumulating achievements and summaries, and polish excellent portfolios.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp6. In the senior year, choose to study abroad and concentrate on the creative transformation of "no design studio".</p>
